Title: Intraclass Correlations for Quantifying Inter-Rater Reliability   
Version: 1.0
Author: Kilem L. Gwet, Ph.D.
Maintainer: Kilem L. Gwet <gwet@agreestat.com>
Description: A series of R functions are made available for calculating various intraclass correlation coefficients used to quantify 
  inter-rater and intra-rater reliability.  The assumption here is that the raters produced quantitative ratings. Most of the statistical procedures implemented
  in this package are described in details in Gwet, K.L. (2014): Handbook of Inter-Rater Reliability - 4th ed.
