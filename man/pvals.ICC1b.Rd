\title{P-value of the ICC under ANOVA Model 1B for arbitrary null values.}
\usage{
pvals.ICC1b(ratings, gam.zero = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{ratings}{This is a data frame containing 3 columns or more.  The first column contains subject numbers (there could be duplicates
if a subject was assigned multiple ratings) and each of the remaining columns is associated with a particular rater and contains its
numeric ratings.}

\item{gam.zero}{This is an optional parameter that represents a vector containing an arbitrary number of null values between 0 and 1
for which a p-value will be calculated. If left unspecified, its default value will be 0.}
}
\value{
This function returns a vector containing p-values associated with the null values specified in the parameter gam.zero.
}
\description{
This function computes the p-value associated with the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) under the one-factor ANOVA model
where each rater may rate a different group of subjects.
