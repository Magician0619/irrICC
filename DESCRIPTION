Description: This package contains a series of R functins for calculating various inter-rater and intra-rater reliability
  coefficients under the assumption the raters produced quantitative ratings. Most of the statistical procedures implemented
  in this package are described in details in Gwet, K.L. (2014): Handbook of Inter-Rater Reliability - 4th ed.
